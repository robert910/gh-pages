	<h1>Abilities</h1>

	<main>

		<p>
			Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess".
			Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he is able to
			use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest
			detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver. Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect,
			being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical conditioning.[94] As a polymath,
			his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe.
			He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the Superman: Doomed story
			arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.

		</p>

		<p>
			has trained extensively in various martial arts, mastering over 127 different types, making him one of the best hand-to-hand
			fighters in the DC Universe. Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire
			team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first
			storyline in JLA.

		</p>

		<p>
			Batman has the ability to function under great physical pain and to withstand telepathy and mind control. He is a master
			of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering information under the identity of Matches Malone,
			a notorious gangster. He is a highly skilled in stealth movement and escapology, which allows him to appear and disappear
			at will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm.

		</p>

		<p>
			Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and often uses extreme methods to extract information from suspects, such
			as hanging a person over the edge of a building. His intimidating and frightening appearance alone is often all that is
			needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining
			characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude
			has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman.

		</p>

		<p>
			Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include
			being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the Batplane), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery.
			In some publications, he underwent some magician training.

	<h3>Technology</h3>

	Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which
	usually share a bat motif. Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal
	with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the batarang
	and the "Batgyro" in Detective Comics #31 and #32 (September; October 1939).

	<h4>Personal Armor</h4>

	<p>
		Batman's body armored costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals. The details of the Batman
		costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations, but the most distinctive
		elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat
		emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black
		cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue. Hence, the costume's
		colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey; as well as black and grey. In the Tim Burton's Batman and Batman
		Returns films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background.
		Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black
		bat in the middle. Ben Affleck's Batman in the DC Extended Universe films wears a suit more faithful to the comic books
		versions, in which the suit is grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.

		Batman's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It protects him from
		gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like
		cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.The overall look of the character,
		particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said,
		"We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same ... Everybody
		loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it."

	<h4>Batmobile</h4>

	The 1966 television Batmobile, built by George Barris from a Lincoln Futura concept car.Batman's primary vehicle is the Batmobile,
	which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with tailfins that suggest a bat's wings. Batman also has an aircraft
	called the Batplane (later called the "Batwing"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper practice,
	the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly
	after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s Batman live-action television show and the Super Friends animated series) stretched
	the practice to campy proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a Batboat, Bat-Sub, and Batcycle, among
	other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such "bat-" names as the bat-computer,
	bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-shark
	repellent bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is
	unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In The Dark Knight Returns, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original
	Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile
	was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier
	armor and new aesthetics.

	<h4>Utility Belt</h4>

	<p>

		Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his utility belt. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting
		tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored
		in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile
		which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled
		into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are guns,
		which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder.

	<h4>Bat-Signal</h4>

	<p>

		When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the
		Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point
		in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.
	</p>

	<p>
		In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s Batman TV series, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed
		the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent
		top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, Wayne Manor, specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the
		desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.

	<h4>Batcave</h4>

	<p>
		The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, Wayne Manor.
		It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for
		his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic Batman: Shadow of the Bat (issue #45)
		and the 2005 film Batman Begins, the cave is said to have been part of the Underground Railroad.
